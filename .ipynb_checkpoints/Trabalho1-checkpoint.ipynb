    "Even with some modifications, such optimization function still has a problem... Note that we are trying to\n",
    "maximize an expected value, but is this what we really want? Mathematicians and economists have noticed a long\n",
    "time ago that, in practice, humans do not actually \"try\" to maximize the expected value, but something else.\n",
    "Economists tried to fix this decoupling between human behavior and what seemed to be the correct mathematical function,\n",
    "and thus introduced what is called a utility funciton. This function is supposed to model our apparent risk-aversion behavior.\n",
    "Yet, this is still problematic, because the choice of such utility function seems arbitrary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the best example of such oddity is revealed in the St. Petersburg Paradox. The paradox is the following. Consider a game\n",
    "in which a fair coin is tossed. If you get \"heads\", then you add two dollars to your pile. If you flip \"heads\" again, you double the current amount in your pile,\n",
    "i.e. the two dollars becomes four, and so on. The game goes on until you flip \"tails\", in which the game ends and you receive the amount of money currently in the pile.\n",
    "The question is then, how much money would you pay to play this game? Here is where things get interesting. If you try to\n",
    "calculate the expected value of this game, you'll find out that it's actually infinite. Hence, if the \"fair\" price to play the game\n",
    "is the expected value, then the \"rational\" thing to do is to play the game for any amount of money...\n",
    "\n",
    "You can already smell the b.s. in the air. We can intuite that there is something off about this. It's not a surprise that this was\n",
    "coined as a paradox, since the \"logical\" answer seems so \"unlogical\". This problem was posed in 1738 by Daniel Bernoulli, which\n",
    "proposed to solve it by introducing the \"utility function\". Yet, this seemed like cheating, since it's not clear how this notion\n",
    "could \"naturally\" emerge from the original problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was only in 2011 that the physicist Ole Peters proposed a new solution, which does not make use of any funky utility function,\n",
    "but instead, relies only in the problem itself. He realized that the St. Petersburg game is not ergodic, i.e.\n",
    "the time-average of the game is not equal to the ensamble-average (also known as \"expected\" value).\n",
    "The only reason the game has infinite expected value is that a tiny fraction of possible games\n",
    "result in absurds amount of money. But you, a single individual, would only be able to get such\n",
    "large amount of money if you played the game a zillion times... And if you actually added the amount of money\n",
    "you had to pay to play each time, you would not make a lot of money. Now we can more clearly see why the expected value of the cash process is not the \"correct\" thing to maximize.\n",
